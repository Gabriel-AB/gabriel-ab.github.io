# Hi, I'm Gabriel

This is my fist web page, so I'm gonna be simple.

The languages I have the most experience are C and Python, currently learning Rust. 

I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer with experience in the field of natural language processing. some of the tools I know are:
- tensorflow
- Scikit Learn
- SpaCy
- matplotlib

## There is two things i like a **lot**
### Clean Code
Of course I follow the clean code rules of the great Uncle Bob. Nothing like a good clean code, simple `classes` with simple `names`, simple `functions`, simple `variables`, a amazing world. This is something that I like to improve by learning more about the language I'm using.

### Optimization
Some of my beliefs are that all first written code must be fast, not super fast, but must at least be fast. If the inicial logic behind the code is unoptimized, there is not much to do.
